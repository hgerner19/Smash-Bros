`Super Smash Bros : Character Portal`
Group project: Holden

# Project Description
The webpage displayed by the code herein is an online portal where users can view information about characters from all Super Smash Brothers games. Additional components of the application will give the user the freedom to add existing characters to their list of favorite characters, as well as add a new character to the list of existing characters. Instead of using an external API, this code mimics an external server by running the data in the local `db.json` file as a server. For this programe to work, the following commands must be performed:


This will establish the local `db.json` file as the local server to pull in data about all the Super Smash Bros characters.

Next, create a separate terminal and type the following commands:
```
cd my-app

```
# How to use this Project
As a user, I can:
* Using the `Navbar` at the top of the page, navigate to (4) separate components at the top of the screen labeled **Home**, **Characters**, **Add Character**, and **Favorites**. When each of these components has been clicked, the url at the top of web page will update accordingly.
## Characters Page
As a user, I can:
* Use the Navbar at the top of the page to navigate to any of the other pages. 
* View a list of **ALL** characters in the SSB universe. 
* Interact with the `Add to Favorites` button or the `Remove from Favorites` on any of the characters. Upon clicking this button, the player card will either be added or removed from a list of characters displayed on the **Favorties** page. 
* `Stretch Goals:` Create a Search bar and/or filter to quickly find characters.
## Add Character Page
Everyone that has played SSB has always wondered what if [ *insert character name* ] from [ *insert game* ] was a character. Well, now you can! As a user, I can:
* Use the Navbar at the top of the page to navigate to any of the other pages.
* Fill out a controlled form for a *New Character* of your choice. 
* Simply type information in the listed fields and click `Add New Player`. This will add the new player to the list of characters on the **Characters** page.
## Favorites Page
Very similar to the **Characters** page, as a user, I can:
* Use the Navbar at the top of the page to navigate to any of the other pages. 
* View a list of **Favorite** characters that have been selected. 
* Interact with the `Remove from Favorites` button on any of the characters. Upon clicking this button, the player card will be removed from the page.
